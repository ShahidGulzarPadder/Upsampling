# Assignment_2_Upsampling
Subtask 1: Implement a bilateral filter      Implement the Bilateral or the Bilateral Median filter, your choice.     Evaluate the filter on an image of your choice (see below).  Evaluation  The Bilateral filter has two parameters, two variances (sigmas), one for the spatial filter (Gaussian, \(w_G\) kernel in the slides), and one for the spectral filter (\(f\) in the slides, also called the range kernel).      Choose four different levels of sigmas for the spatial and four for the spectral filter.     Test all combinations, 16 in total, by running the Bilateral filter on the image of your choosing.     Save the resulting images onto disk.  Subtask 2: Create a guided filter      Convert a bilateral filter to Guided Joint bilateral filter for guided image upsampling.     Apply the filter to upsample a depth image, guided by an RGB image. (You can use an image pair from a Middlebury stereo dataset, or any of your choice.)
